			<h2><span class="accentable">A Common Character</span></h2>
			<p>There's an idea common to both Confucianism and Taoism, though it is more commonly associated with the later. Wu Wei, often translated 'effortless action', is considered to be part of the character of a virtuous person. They live their lives in a manner similar to the ease with which an expert craftsman or profressional goes about their work. To an onlooker, their well-practiced movements appear almost effortless.</p>

			<h2><span class="accentable">Cook Ding</span></h2>
			<p>Taoism uses the term wu wei when referring to typical lower class, simple folk like the character Cook Ding. Cook Ding describes how he started his trade clumsily. When he cut meat, he'd often dull his knife on the bone. Over time he learned from practice and teaching, but still occasionally nicked his blades. Only when he later reached a state of wu wei, when he relaxed into his profession and simply cut with his intuition, did he make clean cuts that never struck bone.

			<h2><span class="accentable">Dancing within the Bounds</span></h2>
			<p>Confucianism doesn't mention wu wei explictly, as a term, but a handful of times. Instead it alludes to this state of effortlessness. If you're familiar at all with Confucianism, you may think its conservative and rigorous systemization of social heirarchy is far from Taoism's wu wei. Probably more akin to the state of 'perfect knowlege' that preceded wu wei in the story of Cook Ding. But Confucians most definitely reach for the same character of action. The example I love the most is 'dancing within the bounds'. Traditional poetry, song and dance were a large part of Confucian studies and culture. One who achieved a deep understanding and ttunement with dance was said to be able to dance within the bounds, moving freely but never overstepping. Virtue, here, is equately with agility in dance, with losing oneself in dance without sacrificing the order and harmony of the artform and doing so with a deftness that noticable by onlookers. </p>

			<h2><span class="accentable">The Character of Virtue</span></h2>
			<p>All this is not to say that virtuous people happen to be good with their hands or can impress all the ladies on the dance floor. It speaks instead to the character of virtue. Virtue isn't knowledge one holds in the head. Not even for the bookish Confucians. Virtue, when truly attained, is the kind of knowledge you have deep down in your bones. It's almost like muscle-memory. It's deep down and automatic. You don't think about it or deliberate. Instead, the action just flows out of you. Effortlessly. </p>

			<p>I explored these ideas while I worked for my Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy. If philosophy is the love of wisdom, and you can't get wisdom except by living knowledge deep down in your bones like Cook Ding, then Philosophy grad school starts to look a little silly, don't 'cha think? <span id="emoji">&#x1F612</span>
