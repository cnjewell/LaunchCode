# for each cmd in the instructions
	# while the sampled character is '-' or '+'
		# take that character and store it in a little angle-substring 
	# once you get a non - or + char, take that substring and perform the following
		# initialize a total rotation variable
		# for each turn in the substring
			# add or subtract the angles to the total
		# then, total % angle -> returns the turn, either +45 or -45
